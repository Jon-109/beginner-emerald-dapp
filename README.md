# Beginner Dapp Integrated w/ The Flow Blockchain

## Attached in the link below is the final product of my beginner dapp that is integrated with the Flow blockchain testnet. Users can log into their Blocto Wallet and change the greeting displayed on the page. Changing the greeting is a free transaction on the testnet that still requries the user to approve the transaction and in the console it displays the transaction ID as well. This app was created through a course developed by Emerald City (aka Jacob Tucker) so all credits to them tbh
